first of all. i think game should be about software web development only (web apps, web service, mobile apps, web game), no need for hacking. each game "day" covers 2 weeks for fast gameplay. before starting game player can choose its avatar (which we gonna need avatar building library , also we making game in react, two languages - azeri and english). also like rpg character player can choose points for these four skills: technical , business, social, creativity. if he has good technical skills he can code better and faster. higher business skills gonna make bonuses on business side. and better social is better for job interviews, getting jobs and even dating sim aspects of game (which we will discuss later). higher creativity can make you come up better, higher success ideas for tech product. for example pre-start he should divide 10 points (or if u have other suggestion for it) between these four. max point per skill is 7. also through game there will be rare moments for improving these skills. (discuss later)

resources are: money and reputation. lets say all players gonna start with same age (21). reputation is dependant on your job experience, tech products you built, your education, your skills - character skills and technical skills (html, javascript, c# and so on)

when starting game character gonna have only 2 tech skills - html, css.
he can upgrade his skills by spending skill points on skills tree, which some skills gonna have requirement, for example learning react or vue u must know js and so on.
and for gaining skill points player must complete jobs - either practicing, building side project, building tech product, or working. higher character technical skills gonna gain you higher skill points.
you (claude) need to give me list of technical skills with prerequirements and spend amount.

when searching on job market player gonna see requirement and 2 weeks salary of job. after applying job, by random chance player gonna get invitation to interview. higher reputation gonna needed for higher success for invitation. interview process gonna be 2 part - technical side is minigame related to logic. and social part is either rng depend on your social point or minigame as well. discuss later. also higher social skills can increase initial salary - for example initial salary is 100 per game day and you have 5 social skills, so you have more than average social skills you agree with employee for 110
each job interview also gain you skill points - if its successfull more skill points
after getting job you gonna do random minigame - we will discuss all minigames later. and if fail your daily jobs more (lets say 3 fail in 5 days) you gonna get fired. also failing day gonna cut from your salary - you get half of it.
in job you will have junior, middle, senior, team lead progressions. for example if u want to being middle you need at least college degree and required tech skills and some reputation. for being senior and team lead you need university degree and higher reputation.

education gonna be simple. you need money for applying degree exam - high school, college, university, and finally academy. exam gonna be in quiz format. we will discuss quiz questions later. degrees needed for better jobs, creating business and so on. for example all jobs gonna require at least high school degree so getting high school degree gonna be one of the first goals of player.

business is simple. you buy some business - simple web service website, or it corporation and etc, and it gives you side money. more business point more bonus money.

practising, building own tech product, software - before starting to this you gonna need idea. depending on creativity, you gonna get random idea (better creativity higher chance for success). ideas also gonna have character skills requirement - for building crm apps for business for example you need higher tech skills, reputation and business skills. after that you gonna start building it - which is gonna be its own minigame. after building it coming debugging phase which is itself another minigame. after that its publishing phase. gaining money from this product you gonna need good idea - which will give you higher random chance, less buggy product, and higher business skills. also i need you (claude) come up with project ideas for this phase. its gonna range from portfolio projects to multi million dollar startup ideas.

life sim aspects gonna be simple - you have energy status - for working you need high enery so u need to gain that from random things - you can buy food, go to movie, spend time with friends, playing with pet, spend time with gf/bf.
